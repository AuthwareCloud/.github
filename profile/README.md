We're building a **secure, modern and scalable authentication** solution for your software, removing the need to build complicated systems and designs to get your software online. View our plans and pricing over at our website, we offer many basic plans for small indie development teams all the way up to **large organizations.**

### We üíñ open-source
That's why all of our applications that can be open-source, are open-source. From our wrappers &amp; examples to miscellaneous software that we may use internally or externally. Here's some of our open-source software, that we've licensed under the MIT license:

- Our [Discord bot](https://github.com/AuthwareCloud/AuthwareBot) is present in our community Discord server and provides us moderation and many other neat tools;
- All of our wrappers are fully open-source, find our [C# wrapper](https://github.com/AuthwareCloud/dotnet-sdk) and [Python wrapper](https://github.com/AuthwareCloud/python-sdk) in our repositories (or the sneaky links)

### üñ•Ô∏è What we use to build our systems
We're all passionate C# developers, that love to explore the limits of the language and it's frameworks. Our website has been built fully from new, modern technologies and frameworks for the C# language such as **Blazor and ASP.NET Core.**
